Flight Checker

The Problem to Solve: 
Last spring I was planning a trip to spain over spring break but I noticed the flight prices would fluctuate daily so I had to check everyday until I found a price I thought was reasonable.

Solution:
Flight checker automates the process of checking the flights everyday and emails you when the flight to the destination is lower than your decided price. 
Now anyone can put in an email, locations, prices, desired travel dates, and every morning have the flights searched for results.

 Implemented the project using Python and Flask framework for web development, integrating Kiwi API for flight information, and Supabase API for secure user authentication and data storage.
